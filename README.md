# chess-nexys4
A chess program in verilog that runs on Digilent Nexys 4 FPGA dev board. Displays through VGA and controls through on-board buttons.

Made with a lab partner in my school's digital circuits class and using example code given by the class

I stupidly forgot to take a picture/video of the finished product but here's a picture of just the chessboard
